# Social Network API

## Description
    This showcases my knowledge in building back-end routes for a social networking site. You can create a user for yourself, add and delete friends, add and delete thoughts (comments), and react (reply) to the comments. 

  ## User Story
    GIVEN a social network API
    WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
    THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
    WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
    THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
    WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
    WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

  ## Technologies Used
